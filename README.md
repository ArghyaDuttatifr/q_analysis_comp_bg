## 🔬 Mathematical Fitting Model

The fitting algorithm models the linear transmission magnitude $\vert{}S_{21}(f)\vert{}$ of a microwave resonator using a **complex Lorentzian resonance model** superimposed on a **complex constant background**.

### 1. ${\lambda/{2}}$ resonator Model Equation
The complex transmission response $S_{21}(f)$ as a function of frequency $f$ is modeled as:

$$S_{21}(f) = \frac{Q_L}{Q_e} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + 2j Q_L \delta(f)} + (A + j B)$$

Fitting is performed directly against the linear magnitude $\vert{}S_{21}(f)\vert{}$:

$$\vert{}S_{21}(f)\vert{} = \left\vert{} \frac{Q_L}{Q_e} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + 2j Q_L \left( \frac{f - f_0}{f_0} \right)} + A + j B \right\vert{}$$

### 2. Parameter Definitions
| Parameter | Symbol | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Resonant Frequency** | $f_0$ ($\omega_r$) | Center frequency of energy storage peak (Hz). |
| **Fractional Detuning** | $\delta(f)$ | Normalized frequency shift: $\delta(f) = \frac{f - f_0}{f_0}$. |
| **Loaded $Q$-Factor** | $Q_L$ | Total quality factor accounting for all loss mechanisms. |
| **External $Q$-Factor** | $Q_e$ ($Q_{ex}$) | Quality factor representing coupling losses to external feedlines. |
| **Complex Background** | $A + j B$ | Baseline constant accounting for attenuation, phase offset, and crosstalk. |

### 3. Extraction of Internal Quality Factor ($Q_{in}$)
The loaded quality factor combines internal dissipation ($Q_{in}$) and external coupling losses ($Q_e$):

$$\frac{1}{Q_L} = \frac{1}{Q_{in}} + \frac{1}{Q_e}$$

The intrinsic internal quality factor $Q_{in}$ is calculated via:

$$Q_{in} = \frac{Q_L \cdot Q_e}{Q_e - Q_L}$$

### 4. Optimization & $\chi^2$ Minimization Strategy
To avoid local minima in steep resonance landscapes, a two stage grid search strategy is used:
1. **Grid Search over $f_0$:** $f_0$ is evaluated over $N_{\text{trials}}$ fixed frequencies within a window RELAXATION RANGE around the peak.
2. **Sub-Optimization:** For each trial $f_0$, non-linear least squares (`scipy.optimize.curve_fit`) optimizes $[Q_L, Q_e, A, B]$ within strict parameter bounds.
3. **$\chi^2$ Scoring:** The optimal parameter set is chosen by minimizing. Here Chi2_norm is the number of points of the data for the fit. Also, I considered the noise variance of the measurement feedline is 1 :

$$\chi^2 = \frac{1}{\text{CHI2 NORM}} \sum_{{i}} \left( y{\text{obs}, i} - y{\text{fit}, i} \right)^2$$

## 📁 Input Data Format

### 1. File Naming Convention
To enable automatic temperature parsing, filenames must start with 'S12' ( as file prefix ) and must include `_T_` followed by the temperature in Kelvin:

The uploaded files have - prefix 's12' , temp. after `_T_` & if the data have 3 peaks of 3000 rows each- so you need to Restrict Row Range from 1 to 3000 for each peaks.
